I have been fascinated with the logistics of programming ever since I read my roommate's Java textbook. After high school, I spent time as a country-side Veterinarian's Assistant, diagnosing horses and cattle for local ranches, so less bad smells seemed like a fair trade when switching to the technology field.

I originated as a self-taught starter, studying in a completely different field, where I stumbled into coding by pure curiosity. I have been involved with projects, where I gained exposure to new programming concepts; experiencing the creative nature that integrates with technology. 

I am stoked to dive into this course, as I recognize the prevalence of JavaScripts utility in current websites and applications. I'm looking forward to creating some cool stuff in this course!
